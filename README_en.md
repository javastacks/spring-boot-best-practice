## :fire: Why learn Spring Boot?

As a universal framework in the Java development world, Spring once formed the SSH trio with Struts2 and Hibernate, becoming the three major pillars of Java Web development. Around 2013, it formed the SSM trio with Spring MVC and MyBatis, becoming the new generation Web development framework "family bucket", which has remained popular until today.

**In order to simplify the difficulty of getting started with the Spring framework**, the Spring Boot framework was born in 2014. It helps developers use Spring components more easily and quickly. It is a framework built on top of Spring, Spring MVC, and others. It relies on native frameworks like Spring and Spring MVC and cannot exist independently.

Learning Spring Boot can simplify the difficulty of using basic Spring components, and it is also the foundation for learning the Spring Cloud microservices framework, **because the foundation of Spring Cloud is Spring Boot.**

Spring Boot represents the real needs of enterprises. It appears on the **job interview skill list for Java engineers and architects, where Spring Boot is almost a required skill.** Therefore, to become a qualified Java programmer, learning the Spring family bucket, creating applications with Spring Boot is the way to go.
